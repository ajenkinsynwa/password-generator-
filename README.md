Creating a password generator using java script 

## Description 

It is important to have a password that we can remember and that is hard for 
others to generate. Using JavaScript I have coded a password generator that 
will create a password using numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters,
and symbols. 

The users will be prompted for choices they would like to use to create 
their unique password numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters,
and symbols. The users can choose the length of the password with up to 128 
characters but not less than 8 characters. Once going through a series of 
simple directions the password will appear in the generator.
